Figures 1 and 2 are created by ps5p1_script.
Figures 3,4,5,6 are created by ps5p2_script1.
Figures 7,8 are created by ps5p2_script2.
I used some functions which I used for other purposes.
I tried to include them in the package, let me know
whether I forgot something.
The script files will try to write figures to a directory
"c:\teaching\14.462 Spring 2004\problem sets"
which you may want to create to avoid error messages.
I did not write many comments in the code, so it will
be difficult to read.
